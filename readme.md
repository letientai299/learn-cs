# Learn C#

Note, code samples and utils while learning C#.

## TODO

- [ ] Code org:
  - [ ] Split by solutions, dirs, or namespaces? How to make sense for all of
        this? What is reasonable?
  - [ ] `Directory.Build.Props`, nested?
    - Why can't we build `./example/APIs/Minimal` using `dotnet build` within
      that folder?
